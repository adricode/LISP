Getting into symbolic computation with LISt Processor (LISP).

LISP is a functional programming language developed by John McCarthy in 1958, who explained its design with a paper in Communications of the ACM<sup>[1]</sup> later.

It was inspired by the lambda calculus (__λ-calculus__)<sup>[2]</sup>, a formal system composed of rules that define expressions (λ-expressions) evaluated on variables as arguments. 

Similarly, Lisp functions perform on symbolic expressions (S-expressions)<sup>[3]</sup>, tree-structured data written as nested lists that define atoms or expressions (_x_ . _y_).

An example of AND function<sup>[4]</sup>:
